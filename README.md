This is a React app that gets the comments for a YouTube video in a single page.

Live demo: https://youtube-comments.herokuapp.com

And why do that you will probably ask, this is a horrible idea. I agree with you.

The only reason is to find quickly with control + F something you want in the comments. For example
the song name. If you try to do that in YouTube you will press END to load more comments a million times.

To run it locally you'll have to provide your YouTube API key in src/component/App.js
